# Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

You have a graph of `n` nodes.  You are given an integer `n` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that there is an edge between `aᵢ` and `bᵢ` in the graph.

Return _the number of connected components in the graph_.

**Example 1:**
